## 👋 About Me

I am **Rajesh Kumar K**, a 21-year-old Gen Z engineer and a **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)**. My professional journey is driven by a commitment to the **DevOps** and **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** ecosystem. I specialize in building automated, resilient, and scalable infrastructure, bridging the gap between core system administration and modern cloud-native technologies.

### 🏗️ DevOps & Systems Expertise
* **Certified System Administration:** As an **RHCSA**, I am certified in core system administration, security, and shell scripting.
* **Automation Roadmap:** I am currently advancing my expertise by studying for the **Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)** certification to master complex automation and configuration management.
* **Cloud & Containerization:** I have hands-on experience working with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS** to orchestrate modern application environments.
* **Observability:** I utilize monitoring and observability tools such as **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to maintain system health and high availability.

### 🧠 AI & Engineering Research
While my primary focus is infrastructure, I maintain a deep technical interest in **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**. I recently developed a two-stage deep learning pipeline for **mitotic cell detection** in histopathological images. This project utilized **YOLOv8** with **SAHI** (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) for detection and a **B-cos ResNet50** for classification and model interpretability.

### 🎙️ Leadership & Personal Growth
* **Toastmasters International:** I am an active leader within Toastmasters, having served as **Vice President** and **Secretary**. I regularly participate in international speech contests to refine my professional communication and storytelling skills.
* **Mentorship:** I value community growth and actively engage in mentorship, serving as a mentee under **Sakshi** and a mentor to **Aarti**.
* **Philosophy & Poetry:** Outside of technical work, I find balance through reading poetry and philosophical literature, such as *The Alchemist* and *Man’s Search for Meaning*.
